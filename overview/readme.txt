Project Overview: NeuralFit AI SaaS Platform

1. Project Name

---

NeuralFit

2. Description

---

NeuralFit is a modern, iOS‑inspired SaaS platform combining two core experiences:

• **AI-Powered Therapist**: An AI therapist accessible via video, voice, and text. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), Whisper for speech-to-text, and ElevenLabs for realistic TTS, the AI offers evidence-based therapy techniques smarter than any human therapist.

• **Anonymous Social Audio Spaces**: Live, real‑time audio rooms where users can talk freely in an uncensored, supportive environment. Inspired by X Spaces, featuring low-latency streaming via LiveKit and moderated chat.

The emphasis is on community and purposeful conversation, with therapy seamlessly integrated but not the primary focus.

3. Goals & Expectations

---

• **User Experience**: Clean, minimalist UI with smooth animations and intuitive navigation.
• **Performance**: Sub-second page loads, low-latency audio/video interactions.
• **Scalability**: Architecture must support tens of thousands of concurrent users and real-time data flows.
• **Security & Compliance**: HIPAA-like privacy standards, secure data storage, encrypted communication.
• **AI Accuracy**: Reliable session context management, retrieval-augmented responses, and confidentiality.
• **Analytics & Monitoring**: Real-time usage metrics, error tracking, and session quality monitoring.

6. Tech Stack

---

**Frontend**
• Framework: Next.js (React) with SSR/SSG
• Styling: Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI
• Animations: Framer Motion
• Auth: Clerk or Auth0

**Mobile (Future)**
• React Native + Expo

**Backend**
• Node.js + Fastify + tRPC (TypeScript)
• or Python FastAPI for AI endpoints
• API Layer: GraphQL (Apollo) or REST

**AI & ML**
• LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o or fine-tuned Mistral/Llama 3
• Open‑Source Therapy Model: TheBloke/MelloGPT-GGUF from Hugging Face (pre‑tuned on counseling dialogues; free and locally deployable)
• Future Custom Training: Llama 3 7B fine-tuned on proprietary therapy transcripts via Hugging Face SFT
• Pipelines: LangChain, LlamaIndex
• Vector DB: Pinecone or Weaviate
• Speech: Whisper (STT), ElevenLabs (TTS)

**Real-Time**\*\*
• LiveKit for audio/video streaming
• Redis for presence & pub/sub

**Database & Storage**
• PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
• Redis (cache, sessions)
• Cloudinary / UploadThing for media

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
• Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)
• IaC: Terraform
• Containerization: Docker
• CI/CD: GitHub Actions

**Security & Monitoring**
• Auth: JWT, OAuth via Clerk/Auth0
• Encryption: TLS everywhere
• Error tracking: Sentry
• Analytics: PostHog

7. Development Phases

---

• **Phase 1**: Scaffold repos, set up CI/CD, basic auth + UI shell.
• **Phase 2**: Core AI therapist MVP (chat/text + simple voice).
• **Phase 3**: Audio space MVP with real-time rooms.
• **Phase 4**: Polishing UX, analytics, monitoring, security audit.
• **Phase 5**: Beta testing, iteration, deployment.

8. Success Criteria
